    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pasta</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Cream</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil 150 grams of pasta according to instructions on the package. I used
        regular penne pasta which was supposed to be boiled for 9 to 11 minutes.
        and drain. Make sure you donâ€™t overcook your pasta, you want it
        al-dente. Note: use only 1 cup pasta if you like more sauce in your
        pasta. While the pasta is boiling chop all the veggies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pasta is boiled, drain it using a colander and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the veggies for 2 minutes. They should remain crunchy. You can use
        other veggies like carrots, peas as well.
      </li>
    </ol>
